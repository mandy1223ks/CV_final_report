\section{Conclusion}
We successfully combine StyleGAN and human pose estimation in an interesting fighting game. Our pose classification achieves excellent performance in most poses that we define. However, using the StyleGAN-based model to reconstruct arbitrary real-face images is still challenging. In the future, we can try other face morphing methods to make our results better. Also, defining much more actions will make the game even more interesting.
