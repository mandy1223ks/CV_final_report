\section{Conclusion}
We successfully combine StyleGAN and human pose estimation in an interesting game. Our pose classification achieves excellent performance in most poses that we define. However, using the StyleGAN-based model to reconstruct arbitrary real-face images is challenging. In the future, we can define much more actions to make the game more interesting.
