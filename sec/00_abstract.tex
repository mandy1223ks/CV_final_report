\lysee{We make an interesting two-people fighting game. It can play on our laptop, and GPU is not needed. The major challenge of this work is to present real-time human action detection using the front
camera and change the players' faces to ugly faces step by step. We combine \textbf{mediapipe} and \textbf{StyleGAN} to achieve it. Besides the live demo, our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the excellent end-to-end performance of this game.}
