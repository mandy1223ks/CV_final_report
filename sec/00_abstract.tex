We implement an interesting two-player fighting game, which can be played on our laptop without the need of GPU. One goal of this work is to present real-time human action detection using the front-facing camera, and we use \textbf{mediapipe} (a real-time human pose detection network) to achieve this goal. 

Besides, the other purpose is to gradually change the players' faces to ugly faces during the game, we utilize \textbf{StyleGAN} to reach this goal. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the excellent end-to-end performance of this game.

Our source code is released at \url{https://github.com/LeoTheBestCoder/CV-Final-Project}, and our complete demo is published at \url{https://youtu.be/0Zamq8Xk2AM}.
