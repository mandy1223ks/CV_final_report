We want to implement a 2-people fighting game. When entering the game, two players will take a selfie respectively as their player avatar in the game. During the game, the camera will capture the players' human pose, reflecting the human pose in the game. When the player raises his/her right hand, for example, the avatar will go right.

Besides, as a player is attacked in the game, the face of avatar (we call it source face) will gradually change into another face (target face). The more health points a player loses, the more his/her avatar will change. The player should try his/her best in order to keep his/her face from turning into other people's face.
